# FDOT_Ads_Scraper
The scripts convert [Current](http://fdotewp1.dot.state.fl.us/procurement/professionalservices/advertise/advnew.shtml) and [Planned](http://fdotewp1.dot.state.fl.us/procurement/professionalservices/advertise/advplan.shtml) Professional Services Ads webpages to table in Excel. The script compares current run with the latest one to check if there are any new advertisements and if there is one, it is saved into a new excel file containing only new ads. Moreover, the scripts create an archive of previous run results with a date stamp.  

**The scripts must be run with RStudio.**
